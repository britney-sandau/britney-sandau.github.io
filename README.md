Dear Teaching Fellow,

This was a fun assignment to do. I really struggled at first trying to figure out how to redirect the page to the correct link. It took many days/hours trying to figure out what was going on and how the link was working. I eventually took the suggestion to go line by line inspecting the original code and discovered how important the "name" element was. I was dumbfounded that this tiny element and the cryptic message after it was what made everything work. Once I figured this out, the rest of the assignment fell into place. I even looked at the styling and tried to style my page the best I could. I only used the styling elements that I was familiar with. For the ones I was unsure of I will ask during an office hour meeting or look it up at w3schools.com.

I have listed all of my sources below. I found w3schools.com to be the most helpful site.

I didn't comment my code since I tried to name my elements according to what they were being used for. I hope this is ok.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I value any feedback you can provide.

Best regards,
Britney Sandau
